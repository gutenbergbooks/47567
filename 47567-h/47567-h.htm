<h2 id="c2">THE GOLDEN-CROWNED KINGLET.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Regulus satrapa.</i>)</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The autumn wanes, and kinglets go,</p>
<p class="t">Sweet-voiced and knightly in their way,</p>
<p class="t0">And all the birds our summers know,</p>
<p class="t">They flock and leave us day by day.</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;Frank H. Sweet, &ldquo;Flocking of the Birds.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In these pleasing words the poet speaks
of the kinglets. Yet his words may hardly
apply to the Golden-crowned Kinglet,
except in the northernmost part of its
range, for it winters from the northern
border of the United States southward to
the Gulf of Mexico. &ldquo;Muffled in its thick
coat of feathers, the diminutive Goldcrest
braves our severest winters, living evidence
that, given an abundance of food,
temperature is a secondary factor in a
bird&rsquo;s existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But little larger than a hummingbird,
though unlike that mite of bird life, it
seeks in the cooler air of northern climes
a place for its nest. It also breeds
throughout the length of the Rocky
Mountains and in the Alleghanies as far
south as North Carolina.</p>
<p>This tiny and &ldquo;charming sylvan ornament,&rdquo;
both elegant in dress and graceful
in movement, is one of the seven known
species of kinglets, of which there are
but three that frequent the New World.
It is very active while searching for its
food. Its colors are such that, as it moves
from twig to twig hunting for insects
among the leaves, it is frequently hard to
locate though its voice may be heard
among the tree tops.</p>
<p>Truly the name kinglet&mdash;little king&mdash;is
not a misnomer, for the Golden-crown
exhibits a decided character in every motion.
It is fearless and though it will
occasionally scold an intruder, wren-like,
it does not visually resent the presence of
man. Often in the forest or even in our
city parks a Golden-crowned Kinglet will
flash by one&rsquo;s face and, dropping to the
ground, seize an insect or worm that its
bright eyes have detected in the grass,
even at one&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Speaking of interesting phases of bird
life, Mr. Keyser says, &ldquo;On the same day
my dancing dot in feathers, the Golden-crowned
Kinglet, performed one of his
favorite tricks, which is not often described
in the books. You will remember
that in the center of the yellow crown-patch
of the males, there is a gleaming
golden speck, visible only when you look
at him closely. But when the little beau
is in a particularly rollicksome mood, or
wants to display his gem to his mate or
kindred, he elevates and spreads out the
feathers of his crest, and lo! a transformation.
The whole crown becomes golden!
That gleaming speck expands until
it completely hides the yellow and black
of the crown.&rdquo; May we not say with Mr.
and Mrs. Grinnell that Mr. Golden-crown
lifts his hat to Mrs. Golden-crown? We
may learn patience and to be satisfied
with nature as we find it, if we will study
the life of the Golden-crown. It is always
happy, always cheerful. Seemingly it
flies from bough to bough as contentedly
in the rain as in the sunshine and in cold
as well as in warm weather. In many
respects this kinglet resembles the warblers,
but it is much tamer. While seeking
its food it exhibits some of the characteristics
of the flycatchers.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster describes its song as beginning
&ldquo;with a succession of five or six
fine, shrill, high-pitched, somewhat faltering
notes, and ending with a short, rapid,
rather explosive warble. The opening
notes are given in a rising key, but the
song falls rapidly at the end. The whole
may be expressed as follows: Tzee, tzee,
tzee, tzee, ti, ti, ter, ti-ti-ti-ti.&rdquo; Its call note
is simply ti-ti uttered in a fine and well
modulated voice that is scarcely audible.</p>

<p>The Golden-crown selects cone-bearing
trees for its nest. This is usually a pensil
structure and is hung from the branches
at from four to fifty or more feet from
the ground. It is globular in form with
the entrance near the top. Mosses and
dead leaves are used in its construction
and it is lined with soft and fine fibers of
bark and feathers.</p>
<p>Someone has said of a Golden-crowned
Kinglet: &ldquo;I often spoke to him as if he
were a real person; and he appreciated
my words of praise, too, without doubt,
for he would come scurrying near, disporting
his head so that I could catch
the gleam of his amber coronal, with
its golden patch for a center piece.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c3">THE TALKING PINE TREE.</h2>
<p>It was a chilly winter Saturday.
Though the winds were cold, the sunshine
was bright and warm. After dinner
Jacob put on his overcoat and new
red mittens and went, as he often did,
with his father, who was sexton of Evergreen
cemetery. While his father was
busy Jacob amused himself.</p>
<p>He had never before noticed how bare
the great trees looked. Their limbs
reached out like hundreds of crooked
arms between him and the blue sky. As
he looked around here and there he could
see a tree wearing a dark green coat.
Most of them were small, but some were
tall and pointed. A pretty good sized,
umbrella-shaped one grew near where
his father was digging a grave.</p>
<p>Full of boyish life and spirits he ran
to it playfully shouting: &ldquo;I am a squirrel
hunting a nut and will climb up
among your branches.&rdquo; But he tried in
vain. The lowest limbs were so high
above his head that he could not reach
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will hunt
a nut on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping on all fours he began to
crawl around. Soon his hand came down
upon something hard under the dead
leaves which covered the ground. Now
he thought he had really found a nut. It
was roundish, with blunt spines and
woody, and like no nut which he knew.
Hunting a loose brick he cracked it upon
a stone. Two or three little round things
with gauzy wings dropped out.</p>
<p>This roused his curiosity. He now
searched round and round for others. He
spied a small branch which had broken
off and dropped to the ground. As he
snatched it up an end whirled round,
striking his face. &ldquo;How you stick!&rdquo;
cried he. He pulled off a mitten to feel
what was so sharp. He noticed that the
branch was bare, black and full of scars
except at the end of each branchlet, where
bunches of green sharp needles about as
large as his mother&rsquo;s darning needles
were growing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, old tree,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where are
your leaves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the tree heard every word which
Jacob said but it could not make Jacob
hear its answers.</p>
<p>At the tip of each branchlet was a pink
bud, and near some of these was a little,
tender thing about the shape of, though
smaller, than the English sparrow&rsquo;s egg.
These he could pinch into pieces. But
lower down on the branchlets, among the
queer needles, were others not so large
nor so dry as the odd fruit which he had
found on the ground. They were not so
easily destroyed. He picked them off and
put them in his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a funny tree! Why do you
not have nuts which hungry boys can
eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jumping to his feet he looked up into
the branches. They were all bare except
for the needles growing on the
branchlets. The tree was dotted with
the odd nuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a tree are you? You are
not at all like our pretty oak or maple
trees. Your branches grow nearly
straight out. I should not like to live in
a graveyard and look at tombstones all
the time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>He hunted around for clods and dead
branches which, in his efforts to throw
over its crown, he threw into and through
the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see, Mr. Tree, some day, I&rsquo;ll
be able to throw higher,&rdquo; said our cheerful
Jacob.</p>
<p>Just then Rover came running to him
and they had one of their jolly romps
on the dry grass and leaves. Presently,
tired out with their sport, both boy and
dog dropped to sleep. Now was the pine
tree&rsquo;s chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacob, Jacob!&rdquo; called the tree; &ldquo;I am
a pine tree.&rdquo; One of the little, green
fairy spirits who made her home among
the branches had cast such a spell over
Jacob that now he could hear every word
the tree said as plainly as when his
mamma spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you come to know me and
my friends better you will love us for
our youth and worth as well as for our
beauty,&rdquo; said the pine. &ldquo;See&mdash;the oaks
and maples are mere dark skeletons.
What you call needles are our leaves.
They never all leave us at once. In our
family our faithful leaves serve us for
two years. When a new growth covered
with fresh needles comes at the end
of a branch the old needles drop, it is
true, leaving our branches full of scars.
Since others never grow in these same
places our larger branches are left bare;
but the bunches of needles on the new
growth keep us always green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hard thing which you found, and
which you supposed to be a nut, was a
mature dry cone. In our cones we hide
our seeds, which have wings, so that they
fly on the wind to a good resting and
growing place. The little, tender balls
which you found near the young bud at
the end of the branchlet is a new cone
just started this year. The harder, darker
growth farther down among the
needles is a last year&rsquo;s cone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My home is not in this country. I
was brought from a country of highlands
and mountains where the Scottish people
live. I am called a Scotch pine. I do
not choose to live in a graveyard, but I
am willing to serve man and God by doing
my best wherever I chance to be. My
comrades and I have been placed here by
mourning friends for a token of the constant
remembrances and love which are
held for their friends who have passed
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our native land my brothers grow
to be very large, sometimes living for
three or four hundred years. As we
grow at the top, keeping our rounded
shape, our lower branches drop off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you only useful for planting in
graveyards?&rdquo; asked Jacob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed! We furnish excellent
timber, called red pine, which is of
great use for fuel and in ship and house
building. When our trees are cut
through the bark, sap runs out. When
this is strained it is called turpentine,
which is used so much in medicine, by
painters and by other workmen. Oil of
turpentine is also made from our leaves
and cones. When you have a very bad
cold your mamma sometimes rubs turpentine
on your chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember,&rdquo; said Jacob; &ldquo;it
has a strong smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dregs harden,&rdquo; continued the
pine, &ldquo;and are called resin. This is used
in making yellow soap, ointments and
plasters. Our wood is burned to make
charcoal, tar and pitch. Even the soot is
saved, and called lampblack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charcoal is good for many things.
Doctors use it. Placed in a cistern filter
it purifies the water. It is burned for
fuel, especially when a fire with no smoke
is wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As water cannot get through tar and
pitch, these are used in protecting wood
from water. Hence they are put on the
outside of ships, on the inside of water
casks, and on roofs. They are used in
making a black varnish with which people
coat iron pumps and fences to keep
them from rusting. Did you see the men
making the hard asphalt pavement which
leads to the vault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. They had a big kettle of
tar, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Stick out your foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob did as told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have shining patent leather tips
on your shoe toes. Ask papa to tell you
how patent leather is prepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lampblack is mixed with white lead
to make paint. If a little lampblack is
used a gray is made. Enough can be
used to make the paint black. Less makes
a slate color.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much you can do! How useful
you are!&rdquo; said Jacob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not all,&rdquo; said the Scotch pine.
&ldquo;In some places my needles are made
into shreds which are used in stuffing
cushions. Our roots, which contain so
much resin that they burn with a bright
blaze, are burned for lights in cottages
of the poor. Fishermen make ropes of
our inner bark. Laplanders and some
other peoples dry and grind our inner
bark. After steeping this in water to remove
the strong taste it is made into a
coarse bread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the tree, who could see
some distance, &ldquo;your father has finished
his digging. If you will come again my
little fairies can again cast a spell so that
we can talk together, and I will tell you
something about my cousins. I have a
large number of first cousins, second
cousins, and more distant ones. Ours is
one of the largest tree families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I will come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then his father&rsquo;s footsteps among
the dry leaves roused Rover, and both
jumped to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed papa; &ldquo;I supposed
that you two rogues had gone home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached home papa, who
knew nothing of pine tree fairies, told
mamma that Rover and Jacob had been
playing &ldquo;babes in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next week was a stormy one and
the days were growing shorter. But on
Friday the clouds cleared and Jacob
begged to go into the cemetery to play
after school. But his mamma said it was
too damp. However, on Saturday afternoon
she said that he might, and he
eagerly donned his overcoat and mittens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, pretty tree,&rdquo; he said
as he and Rover came near.</p>
<p>As the tree said &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;
it tried its best to nod its head and reach
out a limb to shake hands.</p>
<p>The fairy had done as the tree promised,
and Jacob heard. He clapped his
hands in glee. Thinking that Jacob
meant to play with him, Rover showed
that he was ready for a frolic. But Jacob
curtly said, &ldquo;Get down, Rover!
Listen&mdash;the pine tree is talking again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rover could not hear the tree, but he
sat still and looked at his master in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old tree,&rdquo; said Jacob in a gentle
voice. &ldquo;I could scarcely wait until today.
You promised to tell me of your
relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I shall be pleased to do so,&rdquo;
said the pine, who never tired of talking
of the good traits of its family and
friends. &ldquo;Where is the little limb you
had the other day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; picking it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look closely at my leaves. Did you
ever notice anything peculiar about the
way they grow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Oh, I see. The needles grow in
pairs. Two seem to be wrapped together
at the stem end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is it. I have a cousin who stands
just on the other side of that great elm
tree. Under it is a rustic bench. See
if by standing on it you cannot reach a
twig. If you can, bring it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob did as directed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at those needles. Are ours
alike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; these are coarser, longer and
darker than yours; though they grow in
twos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Run back and look at the
cones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he returned he said: &ldquo;I could
not get a cone, but I can see that those
are coarser and larger, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the shape of the tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two grow very much alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a first cousin. Its family lives
on the mountains of Austria. It is known
as black pine or Austrian pine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that tall pine near that
massive monument?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked, looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just behind you,&rdquo; said Scotch pine,
nodding its head in that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I see now. Such a tall,
straight trunk! Its crown grows in a
point, making one think of a high church
steeple piercing the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As its limbs are above your reach it
is useless for you to try to get a branch.
If you will get papa to break you a twig
some day, and you examine it, you will
find that its needles, which are finer than
mine, are in bunches of five. See when
the wind blows how gracefully her
boughs bend and sway. Go there and
look at the cones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off he went. Returning soon, he said:
&ldquo;The cones are not at all like yours; they
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
are long and different in shape. The
silky needles look something like a paint
brush at the end of each twig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a far more beautiful tree than I,
so straight and lofty. Its pointed top
looks down upon all the other great trees
in this cemetery. If you could go
through Canada and northern United
States, especially around the Great Lakes,
you would see great forests of this&mdash;the
white pine. As its wood contains little
resin it looks white, and is not so valuable
for fuel. As it is easily nailed and
worked, it is said to be a soft wood. You
can whittle it with your knife which
Santa brought you. Furniture, shingles,
laths, boards and many other things are
made of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could tramp around the Rocky
Mountains you would find another soft
pine tree, popularly called the sugar pine
because the burnt resin has at times been
used by the Indians for sugar. Coarse
cakes are made from its nut-like seeds.
Its cones grow to be more than a foot
long. Its leaves, too, grow in fives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pine growing in the South,
known as the Southern or Georgia pine,
has yellow, hard wood. It is heavy and
very strong. It makes fine lumber, ties,
fuel, fencing and furniture. It is used in
shipbuilding and for other things when a
durable wood is needed. It is rich in
turpentine, resin and tar. Indeed, the
markets of Europe are supplied with
those articles largely by the Scotch pine
and those of the United States, chiefly
by the Georgia pine. Because of the
length of the southern pine&rsquo;s needles,
which sometimes measure more than a
foot, it is sometimes called the long-leaved
pine. The leaves grow in threes.
Its large cone also contains seeds, which
are eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day when visiting the pine, Jacob
said: &ldquo;When I get big I mean to visit
some of the pine forests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go as soon as you can, then, my boy.
In cutting pine timber men are so
thoughtless and lacking in foresight and
management that they are being cleared
away very fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must try to teach them to
know the pines better and to love them
more for their beauty and their great
usefulness. Then I am sure they will
use better judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jacob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another day Jacob asked: &ldquo;Have you
told me of all your cousins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed. I have told you of
only a few of my nearest ones. There
are seventy first cousins, of which thirty-five
different ones are American trees.
Then there is a host of more distant relatives.
There are the twelve spruces, with
short, sharp-pointed, four-cornered needles
which grow singly all around the
branches. They like cool places, and
make their homes in great forests at the
north or on mountains. The fir sisters
and brothers have flat, blunt leaves growing
on opposite sides of the branches,
making them look like combs. The
larches, who lose their needles in the fall;
the cedars, the junipers, the arbor vit&aelig;,
the great California redwood&mdash;there are
so many I can not name them all! They
all belong to the cone bearing families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob, who loved the talking pine tree,
spent many happy hours in its shade and
learning lessons taught by it. Through
it he came to know of the wonderful
great trees of California; of what the
straight, tall masts of ships see; of secrets
known only by telegraph and telephone
poles; of the sweet sounds of musical
instruments; of things which props
can tell of mining affairs; of the travels
of railroad ties and the tragedies which
occur within their sight; of the water
folk with whom bridge piles neighbor;
of the animals whose hides the evergreen
barks help to tan; of the birds and animals
who seek the shelter of these trees
and feed upon their seeds and young
buds; and of beautiful things with which
loving hands deck the gay Christmas tree
and the hosts of happy children who love
it most of all trees.</p>
<p>Every child who will select a favorite
tree and watch it with patient, loving
care will also find himself helped. Although
it may not be able to talk as Jacob&rsquo;s
talking pine tree did, if he will but
be faithful to its lessons it will teach him
many useful facts; will prompt him to
reach, like a tree, upward and outward,
and to throw out from his life an influence
as healthful and pure as the fragrance
of the pine.</p>

<p class="caption">KING RAIL.
<br />(Rallus elegans.)
<br />&frac12; Life-size.
<br /><span class="small">FROM COL. CHI. ACAD. SCIENCES.</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c4">THE KING RAIL.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Rallus elegans.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The King Rail is the largest of the
American true rails and is favored with
a number of popular names. It is known
as the Red-breasted Rail, the Marsh Hen,
the Sedge Hen and the Mudhen. It
frequents the fresh-water marshes of the
eastern United States and is found as
far north as Maine and Wisconsin and
as far west as Kansas.</p>
<p>This fine bird very closely resembles
the clapper rail which inhabits the saltwater
marshes of eastern North America.
The two species, however, may be easily
distinguished by the difference in size
and color. The clapper rail is much
smaller and the upper parts are more
ashy or grayish in color and the lower
parts are duller and more yellowish.</p>
<p>Fifteen of the one hundred and eighty
known species of the family Rallid&aelig;,
which includes the rails, gallinules and
coots, inhabit North America.</p>
<p>The rails are not fitted for easy flight
and find safety from an enemy by running
and hiding, only taking to flight
when all other means of escape have been
exhausted. They not only have &ldquo;a body
proportioned and balanced for running,
but also capable of compression to the
narrowness of a wedge, in order to pass
readily through the thick growths of the
marshes, and also to aid them, perhaps,
in their peculiar habit of walking on the
bottom under the water in search of
food.&rdquo; Their feet, because of their large
size and the length of the toes, are well
adapted to the soft mire and floating
vegetation in which they live. With long
legs and well developed muscles the rails
are able to &ldquo;run like very witches in
their reedy mazes, and were it not for
their sharp, cackling voices, their presence
would scarcely be detected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unless approached too rudely, the
female when setting on her nest will
allow a very close inspection. She will
seem to be as interested in the observer
as he is in her. There will seem to be
an expression of wonder in her face.
If she is approached more closely than
she likes she slips from her nest and
gracefully runs through the reeds and
grass and soon disappears.</p>
<p>The nest is usually constructed with
flag stems and grasses. When the nests
are built on dry ground they are usually
placed in a depression in a tuft of grass
and somewhat resemble the nest of the
meadow lark. The nests are usually
placed over water in tufts of marsh-grass
or flags. Frequently the bottom of the
nest is in the water and the top a few
inches above it.</p>
<p>Mr. Silloway says: &ldquo;The King Rail
is said to be irritable and quarrelsome
in its disposition, and it is especially
overbearing toward its neighbors. The
species should be named the &lsquo;queen rail,&rsquo;
for the female is without doubt the head
of the family. Is it not she who sometimes
takes possession of the homes of
her meek neighbors, the gallinules? Is
it not she who defends her home so spiritedly
when it is threatened? Hence it
seems to me that the King Rail is more
king by marriage than in his own right.
She lords it over the gentle-spirited mudhens
with whom she dwells, and frequently
saves herself the labor of making
a nest and the time to lay so many eggs,
by appropriating both nest and eggs of
a comfortably settled gallinule. I have
frequently found nests containing incubated
eggs of the Florida gallinule and
fresh eggs of the rail&mdash;indubitable evidence
to me that the rail was the usurper
of the home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c5">BETWEEN THE DAYLIGHT AND THE DARK.</h2>
<p>She sat in the deepening twilight
awaiting the coming of her lover. The
wind whispered in the rustling tree tops,
but she heeded it not, though she turned
her handsome head sharply when a
thoughtless katydid near her sent forth
one shrill note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is late tonight,&rdquo; she murmured
softly, as she gave a graceful little shake
to her fluffy brown suit and settled herself
anew. Then she bent her beautiful
head and gently scratched her ear with
her right reversible toe.</p>
<p>There came no sound of wings, but
the branch on which she sat quivered
beneath an added weight, and she rolled
her round eyes affectionately toward the
new comer, a great horned owl, with a
welcoming gurgle, in which was a note
of expectation. Her lover was a handsome
fellow, with great tufts over his
ears, and he had brought a &ldquo;gift for his
fair,&rdquo; though it was not a dainty box of
bonbons produced from his overcoat
pocket. He lifts his broad wings, bends
his head, and produces from his crop a
newly caught frog. His mistress nestles
close, with fluttering wings and upturned
beak, and receives the great dainty with
an evident pleasure which delights him.
He tries again. This time the convulsive
effort brings forth to light a field mouse,
garnished with two grasshoppers and a
black cricket, which his lady receives with
the pretty infantile attitudes and flutterings
which all ladies think so becoming
and attractive. Then they snuggle up
close together, as is the way of lovers,
and sit so still they might have been mistaken
for a pair of stuffed owls&mdash;indeed
one of them was&mdash;save for the occasional
turning round of the head in that mechanical
way affected by owls, for they
are watchful, as all wood creatures have
need to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didst thou tarry so long, my
brave?&rdquo; she finally murmured, as she
fondly toyed with the soft mottled feathers
on his broad breast.</p>
<p>He lifted his feathery horns angrily at
the remembrance. &ldquo;The blue terror
caught sight of me as I looked forth from
the beautiful dark home in the dead oak
tree which I have selected for thee, my
beloved. It was just as the gaudy daylight
was giving way to the pleasing
blackness of night that I came forth,
thinking all the little day flyers would
have been asleep, but a belated bluejay
saw me and, with lifted crest and shrill
voice, raised the hue and cry. The robin
left his mud daubed nest in the orchard
across the road, the titmouse from his
home in the knot hole of the rail fence,
the nuthatch, the butcher bird and hosts
of others all came, with piercing scoldings,
sharp pecks and fluttering wings.
I might have gone back into the darkness
of our new home and so saved myself
further annoyance, but, light of the
world,&rdquo; as he rolled his eyes fondly toward
her, &ldquo;I wanted not the blue terror
to know where thou wouldst lay thine
eggs&mdash;he is an egg thief, himself, thou
knowest&mdash;so I sailed away into the open,
and, O, the clamor they raised. And see,&rdquo;
showing two or three broken feathers,
&ldquo;what the bold blue terror has done, the
strong voiced and strong winged bluejay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I wish I had been there,&rdquo; muttered
the lady owl vengefully through her
clenched beak. &ldquo;I would have torn his
blue crest from his wicked little head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I would have taken his head
along with it, at least as far as that black
necklace of which he is so proud, if he
had but given me the chance,&rdquo; laughed
the owl grimly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my usual way,
only there were so many of the light,
active little things that when I turned toward
one another would come at me from
the other side, so that my only safety
from annoyance&mdash;for that was all they
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
could do&mdash;was in my swift and silent
wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed,&rdquo; he went on, his great eyes
blazing at the recollection, &ldquo;as if all the
birds in the woods joined the mob, friend
and foe flying wing to wing, the most
innocent seed bird and the bloodiest thief
fighting side by side, and I had to buffet
them with wing and claw, though they
kept beyond reach of my beak,&rdquo; he added
proudly, and he passed his great feather-clad
claw caressingly down his polished
black beak, curved like a scimitar, and
as strong and sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest, my beautiful one,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;how the bluejay and the
woodpecker fight one another, but tonight
they joined forces as if they had
been friends from the dawning of creation;
and when the butcher bird cried
out, &lsquo;He ate three of my children yesterday,&rsquo;
the titmouse&mdash;forgetting the thorn
on which that same butcher bird impaled
her first husband in the early summer&mdash;replied
in fullest sympathy, &lsquo;And he stole
one of my lovely eggs only a week ago,&rsquo;
and then she screamed with all her tiny
might and flew at my head as boldly as
if she had been an eagle. The little
pests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, my hero,&rdquo; murmured the
lady owl as fondly as a coo dove, &ldquo;a man
has his mosquitoes, a dog has his fleas,
there is a horsefly for the horse, and these
little birds are our mosquitoes, our fleas
and our flies. Who-who-who,&rdquo; she stammered
in her rhetorical flight; &ldquo;who has
not his troubles in this world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who-who-who,&rdquo; echoed the owl.</p>

</div>
<p>Of the twenty species of nuthatches
known to inhabit the temperate regions
of the Northern hemisphere, but four
are distinctively American. They are
classed by ornithologists with the tits and
chickadees in the family Parid&aelig;, a word
derived from the Latin parus, meaning
a titmouse. The nuthatches, like the
woodpeckers, are climbers, but unlike the
latter they climb downward as well as
upward and with equal facility. Their
tails are very short and are not used for
support. Their bodies also do not touch
the tree &ldquo;unless they are suddenly
affrighted, when they crouch and look,
with their beaks extended, much like a
knot with a broken twig to it.&rdquo; A sudden
clapping of the hands or a sharply
spoken word will often cause a nuthatch
to assume this attitude. They are busy
birds, yet they are seldom too absorbed
in their work of gathering food to stop
and closely scrutinize an intruder. &ldquo;Few
birds are easier to identify: the woodpecker
pecks, the chickadee calls &lsquo;chickadee,&rsquo;
while the nuthatch, running up and
down the tree trunks, assumes attitudes
no bird outside of his family would think
of attempting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They do not always seek their food in
the crevices of the bark of trees but,
flycatcher-like, will fly outward from
their perch and catch insects on the wing.
Mr. James Newton Baskett relates the
following interesting observation: &ldquo;One
spring day some little gnats were engaged
in their little crazy love waltzes in
the air, forming little whirling clouds,
and the birds left off bark-probing and
began capturing insects on the wing.
They were awkward about it with their
short wings and had to alight frequently
to rest. I went out to them and so absorbed
were they that they allowed me
to approach within a yard of a limb that
they came to rest upon, where they would
sit and pant till they caught their breath,
when they went at it again. They seemed
to revel in a new diet and a new exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Brown-headed Nuthatch is abundant
from Louisiana and Florida to the
southern part of Maryland. It also
strays, at times, farther north, for it
has been taken in Illinois, Michigan and
Ohio. In the pine woods of the Southern
States it passes a happy existence, always
chattering in bird language even when
its head is downward. &ldquo;Each one chatters
away without paying the slightest
attention to what his companions are
saying.&rdquo; Mr. Chapman says: &ldquo;There is
such a lack of sentiment in the nuthatch&rsquo;s
character, he seems so matter-of-fact in
all his ways, that it is difficult to imagine
him indulging in anything like a song.&rdquo;
Though these words have reference to
another species, they apply equally well
to the Brown-headed form, whose only
note seems to be a monotonous and oft-repeated
utterance of a single syllable.</p>
<p>For its nest it selects a suitable hole
in the trunk of a tree, or in a stump, that
is usually not far from the ground. This
it lines with grasses, fine, soft fibers and
feathers. Here are laid about six creamy
white eggs that are spotted with a brownish
color. The parents are attentive to
their young and seldom associate with
others of their kind till these family cares
are finished. Then they become more
sociable and are found in companionship
not only with other Brown-heads but also
with woodpeckers, warblers and chickadees.</p>

<h2 id="c8">MY RED-HEADED NEIGHBORS.</h2>
<h3 class="generic">I.</h3>
<p>For five years, with each returning
spring, a pair of red-headed woodpeckers
has come, to make their nest and rear
their brood of young near my cabin
door. It was on a cold drizzly day the
last of April, when I first observed my
new neighbor. He was closely watching
me as he dodged about the trunk of a
dead tree standing in the yard.</p>
<p>Unmindful of the falling rain, he put
in the day pecking and pounding away,
seemingly in search of food, occasionally
flying away or hitching around the tree
as some one passed, returning to his
quest as soon as the coast was clear.</p>
<p>Not until the next morning on awaking
and hearing my neighbor industriously
hammering away, did I suspect he
was making a nest, having selected a
place on the trunk of the tree about ten
feet from the ground, and facing the
noon-day sun. He proved to be no
stickler for time, working early and late
with short intermissions, when he would
dart out into the air and stop some passing
insect that was quickly disposed of.
At the end of two weeks the nest had
been completed and on the same day the
female arrived. Was it a coincidence?
It would seem so, for each succeeding
year the male preceded his mate by a
fortnight, in which time the place was selected
and the new home made ready in
which there was no straw, no feathers,
nothing but the deep cavernous pocket,
clean and fresh, perfumed with the pungent
odor of decaying wood.</p>
<p>As the days went by they came to be
less afraid of and more neighborly with
me, paying little or no attention to my
passing or repassing.</p>
<p>After repeatedly testing every available
object in the vicinity of the nest, the
male finally selected as his drumming
place the roof-board of the cabin, where
in lieu of song, he beat off many a short
strain, like the roll of a snare drum, that
was intended for and easily heard by his
mate as she kept warm the eggs in the
nest near by.</p>
<p>In the matter of incubating each took
part, though the female devotes by far
the more time, usually remaining on the
nest from one to two hours, when the
old man would spell her for about twenty
minutes, in which time she makes her
toilet and indulges her insectivorous appetite.
At the end of two weeks they
carried out of the nest and dropped, as
they flew across the yard, the broken
fragments of shell. Now the greatest
of all mysteries has taken place. Like
some beautiful creation of art that is to
be, but as yet is an unexpressed thought
in some human brain, so the bird within
the egg is but a thought till, warmed
by the parent&rsquo;s soft downy breast, the
life lines throb and pulsate till the swelling
life within bursts the shell. Now instead
of eggs requiring warmth the old
birds have two hungry mouths demanding
food, that keeps them busy. Yet
they knew it, knew it all from the very
first; every act was intelligent, not instinctive.
During the first days of the
baby birds, much care was given to the
preparation of their food; the legs, wings
and antennae were removed from each
bug or beetle. On some dead limb convenient
to the nest, a small hole the size
of a lady&rsquo;s thimble had been prepared,
and into this improvised mortar the body
of the insect was placed and pounded to a
pulp before feeding. This care was not
long continued, as the young birds were
soon capable of eating whatever is given
them.</p>
<p>The next ten days were full of business
for my neighbors. Throughout the days
they were constantly in pursuit of the
passing life that filled the air. Each
catch was quickly delivered to the baby
birds, whose appetite seemed never to be
satisfied.</p>
<p>The young birds quickly grew to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
squabs, and their bodies were covered
with a downy coat resembling fur more
than feathers. Soon came the last week
in the home before their formal &ldquo;coming
out.&rdquo; Feathers quickly took the place
of down; the rapid feeding was greatly
lessened, to which the baby birds made
constant complaint in a whimpering cry
as they peeked out of the nest into the
big world where so soon they were to be
launched on their first flight, never to return
to the nest.</p>
<h3 class="generic">II.</h3>
<p>It was about the tenth of May of the
following spring when my red-headed
neighbor returned from his southern
trip, where he had spent the winter. He
was soon hard at work and had the lawn
sprinkled with his white chips about the
root of a pine stub, as he burrowed into
the wood a few feet above, where he was
making a new nest, the spot having been
selected during the past summer. Here,
at that time, he had done some preliminary
work in the way of a prospect hole,
evidently with the view of returning.</p>
<p>With a quick hammer-like stroke of
the head, he drove his sharp polished
beak into the decaying wood, rapidly repeating
the strokes till the pulpy fiber
was broken down and then with a
mouthful of the loosened fragments, he
hitched back out of the entrance, flinging
the chips to the wind.</p>
<p>After a quick survey of the surrounding
and a peek around the tree to see if
there was any approaching danger, he
dove into the hole again to make further
excavations, soon returning, tail first,
with another mouthful of refuse. After
several days&rsquo; work on the new nest, he
came in contact with the hard resinous
heart of a knot that he was unable to remove.
To get by this obstruction and
still be able to utilize the work done, he
changed the entrance from a circle to
an ellipse by extending it downward.
This bit of strategy worked well in getting
by the difficulty, but it proved to be
only temporary.</p>
<p>The nest was completed in the allotted
two weeks and the female came on time.
After a very warm greeting she was
shown the nest for her approval; but on
sight of the new-fangled entrance, she
halted, showing her disapproval in many
ways. To overcome her objections, the
old man went in and out as a demonstration;
then hopping close up to her side,
he talked in a low voice, making many
gestures with his head, sometimes picking
at the tree in an absent-minded way,
as a man thoughtlessly whittles while
pleading his cause. Seeing that she did
not readily assent, he went in and out
three or four times in rapid succession;
then sidling up to her again began his
persuasive chatter, but all to no purpose;
she gave a decided answer and flew
away.</p>
<p>After a little hesitation he followed
her. In about an hour they came back.
After some maneuvering about the yard
he got her back to the nest, but not in
it. He tried in every way, but no amount
of coaxing could induce her to go in, and
refusing to listen longer to his argument,
she again flew away. Now he was disconsolate,
flying away, then returning
to go in and take another look at the nest,
then flying to the housetop to pout. Yes,
pout, for at all other times he would
drum and make a great deal of noise;
now, he was sulky and silent.</p>
<p>Next morning they came back, when,
if possible, he tried harder than ever to
get her to inspect the nest, but without
success. She was obdurate, and, after
sitting quiet until he was through his
demonstrations and chatter, she flew
away over the fields, uttering a loud cry
as she left him sticking to the side of the
tree. He sat still a few moments, seemingly
in a brown study, then he began
hopping about the trunk of the tree,
where in a short time he had selected
a place and gone to work with a will in
making a new nest, that was completed
in a little more than eight days. Very
little was seen of the female during the
completion of the new home. She was
in the yard a few times, but never near
the tree where the male was at work.</p>
<p>He had made no mistake this time, the
entrance was round and clean cut as an
augur hole. When the madam was escorted
to the new nest there was no hesitation
about inspecting it; she entered at
once. Coming out a moment later, she
made it known that the nest was satisfactory.
Then the old man was jubilant,
expressing it by voice and action. From
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
this moment domestic affairs went on as
usual and the family jar was forgotten,
so far as an outsider could observe.</p>
<p>Eggs, baby birds, busy days, fall and
southern journey, ended this year with
my pleasant summer neighbor.</p>
<h3 class="generic">III.</h3>
<p>Many times during the following winter
they were the subject of my thoughts.
I wondered where they were and whether
they would return. Yes, early one morning
of the next spring I was awakened
by his beating a reveille in the same old
place on the roof-board of the cabin.
With little delay he selected a place for
the new home. Then followed a fortnight
of hard work and vigilance when
the excavation was completed and only
awaited the coming of his better half,
who was as prompt in her arrival.</p>
<p>There are families to raise; there are
thousands of flies, bugs and beetles to
catch, for which they are never given
credit, but let them take a berry and it is
&ldquo;Johnnie, get your gun.&rdquo; Early one
bright morning in July there was noise
and bustle about the woodpecker home.
It was not difficult to guess what was
going to take place. The parents were
close by the nest on the side of the tree.
The little birds had crowded out of the
entrance, eager for their first flight,
which, like the first tottering steps of a
baby, is attended with much chatter and
nonsense that is not understood.</p>
<p>The mother set an example by flying
to a tree some fifty feet distant. The little
birds followed with a labored effort
and, striking the tree with a thud near
the ground, managed to stick fast. Now
began their arboreal life of tree climbing
at which they were awkward at first
and had many falls. The young birds
were a soft smoky gray. There was no
sign as yet of the cardinal cap and white
bodice with black chevrons, which would
make them so conspicuous during the
next year.</p>
<p>In their daily visits to the yard each
parent chaperoned one of the baby birds,
teaching it all the tricks in the woodpecker
trade, as they conducted it from
tree to tree where they searched amid
the bark and worm holes for morsels of
food that had been secreted there.</p>
<p>One day late in October they failed to
return; this ended another year and
brought another separation.</p>
<h3 class="generic">IV.</h3>
<p>As promptly as ever the following
spring found my summer tourists in
their old haunts, each year getting a little
closer if possible to the cabin with their
nest.</p>
<p>Household affairs went along smoothly
till one day the old man was keeping
house while the madam had gone out
for lunch. At the expiration of about
twenty minutes he came out of the nest.
As he flew away he gave a loud call
that on former occasions had invariably
brought his mate to take charge of the
nest, but to this call she did not answer.
She never returned. He waited a few
moments, calling for her, then returned
to the nest. Ten minutes later he came
out again, repeating the call several times
as he flew from tree to house and back
again to the nest, about which he showed
much concern. Five minutes more and
for the third time he left the nest, flying
down in the orchard where the female
often went for food. Soon returning
he went direct to the nest, seeming
to understand that some misfortune had
overtaken his mate.</p>
<p>Like Mark Tapley, when the occasion
demanded he came out strong, for with
scarcely an intermission he stuck to the
nest for the next three days. Then he
carried out the broken shells and began
bringing food for two mouths that were
always agape. With a desire to assist
him I daily placed bits of food on a certain
stump in the yard. He soon came to
understand the meaning of my visits and
to regard these tit-bits as belonging to
himself. He would fly to the house top
and watch me put out the food. As soon
as I turned away he would drop off the
roof, spread his wings, slide down on
the air with a long graceful sweep, bringing
up on the edge of the stump.</p>
<p>Nodding and chattering, he hitched
around the stump, tasting each bit of
food, eating what he liked, but rarely
giving any of this food to the babies.
No matter whether he ate it or not, no
other bird was permitted to trespass.</p>
<p>The undivided care of the family left
little time for personal attention. He
looked shabby and forlorn by the time
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
the young birds were old enough to quit
the nest and seek their own food. Then
he spent much time in mending his appearance.</p>
<p>Each passing year my attachment had
grown for my summer visitors. The
thought that he might never return, owing
to the loss of his mate, worried me.</p>
<p>The summer passed; the days grew
short and the night grew frosty. The
blackbird family would soon be on their
way to the sunny south, and I should
miss their familiar voices and many cunning
pranks about the yard.</p>
<h3 class="generic">V.</h3>
<p>Early one May morning the next
spring I was greatly pleased to hear
the well remembered call. I knew my
old-time friend had come to spend his
summer sojourn in the yard amid the
scenes of former years.</p>
<p>He flitted about the yard in his old
familiar way, tapping off his short quick
rattle on the roof-board which reverberated
through the cabin.</p>
<p>He was happy again. Why not? He
had brought with him a new bride. She
was afraid of me. He showed her by
example that I would not hurt them, but
on sight of me she slipped around the
stumps and trees, and at the least approach
flew away.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c10">THE SHARP-SHINNED HAWK.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Accipiter velox.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Sharp-shinned Hawk is a hardy
and courageous bird with an extended
range, covering North America as far
south as Panama. Unlike the larger
number of birds, it breeds throughout
its range, even as far north as the Arctic
circle. In the fall months it passes over
the middle states in large numbers. One
writer says that he observed several hundred
during a single day&rsquo;s tramp, the
majority flying very high in the air.
In the spring, usually in March and
April, the same scene is repeated during
their northward flight.</p>
<p>Much of the bad repute in which the
hawks are held is due to the depredations
of the Sharp-shinned and its sister species
the Cooper&rsquo;s and goshawks. All
these feed, to a great extent, upon the
smaller birds, grouse and poultry. The
smaller mammals, such as the troublesome
field rodents, form a much smaller
proportion of their food than is the case
with the other hawks.</p>
<p>Dr. A. K. Fisher, speaking of the
Sharp-shin, says: &ldquo;Little can be said
in favor of this hawk, although its daring,
courage and impudence are to be
admired. A score of valuable species
suffer because they belong to a class
which includes two or three noxious
kinds. However, like most villains, it
has at least one redeeming quality, and
that is its fondness for the English sparrow,
our imported bird nuisance. This
Hawk is gradually learning that there is
a never-failing supply of food for it in
the larger towns and cities, and it is not
uncommon in Central Park, New York,
all through the winter, where the writer
has witnessed it chasing sparrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sharp-shinned Hawk is brave and
full of dash and spirit. It does not hesitate
to attack birds fully as large as itself
and in one instance it was known to
strike down a night heron, which obtained
its liberty only because its discordant
squawks so disconcerted its ordinarily
cool and collected enemy that it
was frightened away. Even though its
wings are short and seemingly not fitted
for rapid progress, its flight, when in the
pursuit of prey, is very swift and direct.
&ldquo;No matter which way the selected victim
may turn and double, his untiring
pursuer is equally prompt, and only
rarely will it miss capturing its quarry.
Once struck, death fortunately follows
quickly, as it fairly transfixes its victim&rsquo;s
vitals with its long and sharp talons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Audubon well describes the habits of
this bird. He says: &ldquo;While in search
of prey, the Sharp-shinned Hawk passes
over the country, now at a moderate
height, now so close over the land, in
so swift a manner that, although your
eye has marked it, you feel surprised
that the very next moment it has dashed
off and is far away. In fact, it is usually
seen when least expected and almost
always but for a few moments, unless
when it has procured some prey and is
engaged in feeding upon it. The kind
of vacillation or wavering with which it
moves through the air appears perfectly
adapted to its wants; for it undoubtedly
enables this little warrior to watch and to
see at a single quick glance of its keen
eyes every object, whether to the right
or to the left, as it pursues its course.
It advances by sudden dashes, as if impetuosity
of movement were essential to
its nature, and pounces upon and strikes
such objects as best suit its appetite, but
so very suddenly that it appears quite
hopeless for any of them to try to
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nest of this species is usually built
in dense hemlock or other cone-bearing
trees, though a deciduous tree is sometimes
selected. It prefers also a site not
more than twenty to forty feet from the
ground. It is said that the nest is sometimes
built in the crevices of cliffs or in
hollow trees. This may be the case in
Arctic regions, but it is not the usual
habit of the bird within the borders of
the United States. The nests are very
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
large, as compared with the size of the
bird, varying in diameter from twenty
to thirty inches, outside measurement.
The walls are usually constructed with
twigs and lined with smaller ones and
strips of the fibrous inner bark of coniferous
trees. Instances have been reported
in which the walls were nearly
eight inches in thickness.</p>
<p>As a rule the Sharp-shinned Hawk
does not defend its nest from the attack
of intruders. There are, however, a few
instances recorded in which both the male
and female birds fought a person who
was climbing to their nest, by repeatedly
striking at the intruder.</p>
<p>As befits a bird that possesses such a
character as that of the Sharp-shinned
Hawk, it is practically a voiceless bird
and seldom utters a sound except when
its nest is approached. At such times
its cries have been described as like those
of a flicker.</p>
<h2 id="c11">BIRDS ON THE WING.</h2>
<p>In a picturesque little hill-town in
eastern Massachusetts, where I was
spending the summer, I had opportunities
for studying birds, their language, and
their customs. I shall not soon forget
a remarkable sight in the heavens on
the evening of August 26. I was suddenly
attracted by an unusual twittering
and calling of the birds, and, on looking
out of a window, I saw a multitude of
birds of various sizes, from the tiniest of
hare-birds, or sparrows, to birds as large
as robins, flying in all directions and
filling the air, it seemed, with their songs
and their soft little notes. Ah, I thought,
the birds are having a gala day, a picnic,
or a ball, or perhaps a regatta. They
were sailing, soaring, whirling, diving,
dipping, in intricate mazes, yet with a
certain method that was both bewildering
and charming. Perhaps they were trying
their wings for their southern journey;
perhaps they were merely taking a twilight
constitutional en masse. The hour
was a little past six o&rsquo;clock. The southern
sky was pale blue, overspread with
soft, translucent clouds of opaline hues,
paling and flushing&mdash;a most fascinating
picture of itself, and a fine background
for the bird parade. All around great
trees rose in billowy masses of emerald
green, maples and elms predominating;
while, standing like tall sentinels, two
giant Lombardy poplars rose above them
all, looking straight up to the heavens.
In pauses of the dance the birds seemed
to sink into these bowers of green, and
for a few moments no bird was seen.
Then, from somewhere, one came sailing
through the air, then two, then three,
with little notes of command, as when
the leader of an orchestra with his baton
begins the overture, and then a general
rush of wings and the whirling and
wheeling and dipping and darting was
again in full play.</p>
<p>This display of bird maneuvring continued
for about half an hour. I viewed
it from a doorway where I could command
the whole scene, which was enchanting
and something which I had
never before seen.</p>
<p>I have not the presumption to suppose
that it was a field-day review gotten
up for my especial benefit; yet I
enjoyed it quite as much as if it were.</p>
<p>It is possible that they were swallows
out on a foraging expedition, for the day
before a shower of small, green flies
swept through the air, lighting here and
there and everywhere within its radius.
Perhaps the birds had discovered a school
of these flies in the air and took sudden
advantage of the aerial sporting grounds.
Whatever may have been the occasion, I
wonder if such bird parades are often
seen.</p>

<h2 id="c12">A SUNSET CLUB.</h2>
<p>The mere idea of another club may be
unwelcome in these days of many clubs,
yet I am so bold as to desire the existence
of a new one; and I would urge
all who can, to become members of it
as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Unlike most clubs, it will have no officers,
nor any rules and regulations;
neither will there be initiation fees nor
dues to pay.</p>
<p>The object of the club will be the study
of art, as it is displayed in Nature&rsquo;s
studio; and the only requisites for membership
are a love of beauty and a few
minutes&rsquo; time each day. The club will
be in session every day at sunset, and
all members are urged to be present at
any place where they can command a
view of the western sky. They will thus
be enabled to study the latest picture
from the brush of that master artist, Nature.</p>
<p>No art gallery on earth can afford its
visitors such a succession of masterpieces
as will be open to the view of all
members of this club. There is no artist
so resourceful, none capable of giving
such an endless variety of colors and effects
as Nature.</p>
<p>To attempt to describe the beauties
that are daily set before us would be
vain; for who can adequately express
in words the marvels of a sunset sky?
No mere words, however carefully chosen
and accurately used, can convey to the
mind its unspeakable glories. These
must reach us through our eyes, those
&ldquo;windows of the soul.&rdquo; Shall it be said
of us that we &ldquo;have eyes and see not&rdquo;?</p>
<p>This evening the sun went down in a
blaze of orange fire, deep and transparent,
and a few minutes after the great
ball had dropped below the horizon, the
orange glow at the base melted into pale
green above, then clear yellow and delicate
pink, with infinite graduations of
exquisite shading. Words fail, and leave
me helpless before such a masterpiece
I can only hope that many other people
were enjoying it with me, as its beauties
stirred my inmost soul.</p>
<p>Some days ago the sun&rsquo;s setting was
followed by one great expanse of deep
orange red from the horizon up to a
bank of cloud which hung like a gray
curtain, slightly raised, across the western
sky. Another day the afterglow
was an inimitable, transparent lemon-yellow,
across which were stretched two
horizontal bars of rose-colored cloud. In
the foreground of these pictures are the
beautiful trees, which, having now laid
aside their leafy robes, appear in their
loveliness and diversity of outline. A
good opera glass is a great aid to the
fuller enjoyment of the pictures, as it
brings out the perspective more clearly,
and deepens and intensifies the colors.</p>
<p>When a day has been clouded and dull,
some may think it not worth while to attend
the meeting of the Sunset Club.
But they are mistaken. Who that admires
a beautiful picture in black and
white&mdash;a fine engraving&mdash;can fail to see
the beauty of this sunset picture; this
living picture in half tones, which is so
superior, so much more perfect in every
detail than the work of man? Nay, never
miss a meeting if you can possibly be
present: never fear that you will fail to
find beauty there if you look for it.</p>
<p>Let us not complain if we cannot possess
works of art wrought by human
brains and hands, when we often fail
even to look at, much less appreciate, the
daily art of Nature which is our birthright,
and which perhaps we regard but
lightly, because it is free to everyone with
seeing eyes and beauty-loving soul. Let
us rather cast off the scales that blind our
eyes and hide from us the visible expression
of a Creator&rsquo;s love, the beauty of
Nature.</p>
<p>And our lives shall be enriched an
hundred fold.</p>

<h2 id="c13">QUARTZ.</h2>
<p>This is the most abundant, most durable
and most indestructible of common
minerals. There is scarcely a sand
beach, field or mountain side upon which
this mineral cannot be found in some
form or other. Its abundance is due not
so much to its excess in quantity in the
underlying rocks as to the fact that, being
harder and less easily decomposed than
other minerals, it remains after they are
worn away.</p>
<p>Though so common, it appears in so
great a variety of colors and different
kinds of structure that a large collection
of minerals <i>looking</i> very much unlike
might all be made up of Quartz. If they
were all of Quartz they would have the
following characteristics: Hardness, 7
(cannot be scratched with a knife blade);
specific gravity, two and a half times as
heavy as water; no cleavage; fracture
conchoidal (shell-like); infusible before
the blowpipe; insoluble in common
acids. The numerous varieties of Quartz
can be grouped into two classes, the
pheno-crystalline (plainly crystalline)
and the crypto-crystalline (obscurely
crystalline). This article deals with the
plainly crystalline varieties. These include,
among other varieties, rock crystal,
amethyst, rose quartz, smoky quartz, and
sagenitic quartz. These varieties all occur
in well formed crystals, and all have
a vitreous luster, i. e., luster like that of
glass. The differences between them are
almost exclusively differences of color.</p>
<p>Rock Crystal&mdash;This is quartz in its
purest form. Typical rock crystal is perfectly
transparent and colorless, but the
mineral is often more or less clouded
and opaque. By the ancients it was
supposed to be petrified ice, and
hence the Greeks applied to it their
word for ice, from which we get
our word crystal. The belief in its
ice origin survived to a comparatively
late period, for in 1676 Robert Boyle
opposed the idea, stating that the
quartz could not be ice, first because it
was two and a half times as heavy as
water, and second because it was found
in tropical countries. The belief of the
ancients probably came largely from the
fact that the quartz they knew was obtained
from the peaks of the Alps. They
reasoned that it was ice that was frozen
so hard that it would never melt. Fortunately
our present knowledge of chemistry
prevents us from any longer confounding
the two substances, for we
know Quartz is oxide of silicon while
water is oxide of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Quartz in the form of rock crystal occurs
in all parts of the globe, and for
the most part in well-formed crystals.
These crystals are usually six-sided, and
usually have the form of a prism capped
by a pyramid. Hot Springs, Arkansas,
and Little Falls, New York, are the best
known localities in our own country for
this form of crystallized quartz. The Little
Falls crystals are exceptionally brilliant
and well formed. From this locality
and others the material, cut or uncut, is
often known as diamonds, and sold as
such. Such stones can, of course, be
easily distinguished from true diamond,
for while they will scratch glass, their
hardness is much below that of the king
of gems and they utterly lack the internal
fire of the latter.</p>
<p>Rock crystal occurring in large, clear
masses is often cut into ornamental and
useful objects such as seals and paperweights,
and especially into balls. The
latter industry flourishes especially in
Japan, and perfectly clear quartz balls
six inches in diameter are made there.</p>
<p>Rock crystal is also used extensively to
cut into eyeglasses and spectacles in place
of glass, some considering it less detrimental
to the eyes than glass. It is also
occasionally used for mirrors, it being superior
to glass for this purpose, in that
it does not detract from the rosiness of
the complexion.</p>
<p>Among the ancients rock crystal was
much more highly prized than among us,
as it answered them many of the purposes
for which we now find glass more suitable
and cheaper. Wine glasses were made
from it, though of course at great cost,
a thousand dollars being considered a
small price for one. Lenses of rock crystal
were used to concentrate the rays of
the sun for cauterizing wounds and also
to light fires, especially sacrificial ones.
Roman ladies were also accustomed to
carry balls of rock crystal in their hands
in summer for the sake of the coolness
they afforded. The ladies of Japan are
said to do the same at the present day.</p>

<p>The stone was in former times often
stained different colors, and thus all sorts
of imitation gems were produced. The
modern method of making doublets has
now superseded this art.</p>
<p>Amethyst.&mdash;This is the name given to
the violet or purple varieties of crystallized
quartz. The color has often been
supposed to be due to small quantities of
oxide of manganese, but is more probably
the result of a content of organic matter,
as the color can usually be mostly burned
out by heating the stone. By partial heating
the color is changed to yellow, and
much so-called citrine is simply burned
amethyst.</p>
<p>Quartz having in a general way the
amethystine color is comparatively common,
but for gem purposes only that
transparent and of good color is available.</p>
<p>Important localities for gem amethysts
are Southern Brazil, the Ural Mountains,
Ceylon, and occasional finds in the
States of Maine, North Carolina, Pennsylvania
and Montana in our own country.</p>
<p>Very commonly where crystallized
quartz occurs, crystals of an amethystine
hue are to be found, so that to enumerate
localities of the mineral would be a considerable
task. Good cut amethysts command
a fair price, though they are much
less valuable than formerly. Three or
four dollars a carat is a fair price at the
present time. At the beginning of this
century Queen Charlotte of England is
known to have paid $10,000 for an amethyst
for which $500 could now hardly be
realized. One reason for the greater esteem
in which amethyst was formerly
held is probably the virtue ascribed to it
of shielding its wearer from the effects
of drinking too much wine. Its name is
derived from two Greek words, meaning
&ldquo;not to inebriate.&rdquo; The drinking cups of
the Romans were often made of it, partly
for the above reason and partly on account
of their belief that any poison
placed in such a cup would be rendered
harmless. Amethyst is the &ldquo;birth stone&rdquo;
of the month of February, and St. Valentine
is said always to have worn an amethyst.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The February born shall find</p>
<p class="t0">Sincerity and peace of mind,</p>
<p class="t0">Freedom from passion and from care</p>
<p class="t0">If they an amethyst will wear.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Rose Quartz.&mdash;This form of quartz,
the color of which is indicated by its
name, is rarely of sufficient transparency
to be prized as a gem. Cut, however,
into various ornaments, it makes objects
of considerable beauty. Its luster, instead
of being glassy like that of other
forms of quartz, is nearly always more
or less greasy. The ingredient which
gives its color is not known. It is probably
some organic matter, since the color
disappears on heating and, unfortunately
for the extended use of the stone, fades
considerably on exposure to light. There
are numerous localities whence rose
quartz of good color may be obtained,
although it is not of so common occurrence
as most other varieties of quartz.
The best rose quartz in this country
comes from Oxford County, Maine, and
the Black Hills. Foreign localities are
the Urals, Brazil and Ceylon.</p>
<p>Smoky Quartz.&mdash;This variety of
quartz is often known as &ldquo;smoky topaz,&rdquo;
a misleading term, since the mineral is
not topaz at all. As its name implies, its
color is like that of smoked glass, all
gradations occurring between a mere
tinge to color so dark as to render the
mineral practically opaque. The color
often varies considerably in the same
crystal, being darker and lighter in spots.
The coloring matter is undoubtedly carbonaceous
and organic in nature, for
when a crystal is heated it gives off a
smell of burning organic matter, and by
heating for some length of time the coloring
may be entirely burned out. At
an intermediate stage in such heating the
color becomes brown or yellow, and
stones of this color are often cut as gems
and known by the name of &ldquo;Spanish topaz&rdquo;
or &ldquo;citrine.&rdquo; True citrine is, however,
transparent quartz with a natural
yellow color. The most remarkable crystals
of smoky quartz known are some
that were found in 1868 in a hollow in
granite in a locality in the Canton Uri,
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Switzerland. About 3,000 pounds of well
formed crystals were there found, the
largest and best of which are preserved in
the Berne Museum. They are so unique
that special names have been given them.
One about two and one-half feet long,
and weighing nearly four hundred
pounds, is known as the &ldquo;Grandfather&rdquo;;
another, somewhat smaller, but more perfect
in form, as the &ldquo;King,&rdquo; and two of
nearly equal size, weighing about one
hundred and forty pounds each, are called
&ldquo;Castor and Pollux.&rdquo; The smaller crystals
obtained from this and neighboring
regions in the Alps are for the most part
of great perfection of form and color.
Aside from these localities in the Alps,
the most remarkable crystals of smoky
quartz come from the region of Pike&rsquo;s
Peak, in our own country. While not
reaching the size of the Alpine crystals,
they are often perfect in form and color,
and gems to the value of thousands of
dollars are annually cut from the supply
there obtained. Alexander County,
North Carolina, also furnishes many
crystals. Smoky quartz may be called
the national stone of Scotland, the name
by which it is known being &ldquo;Cairngorm
stone,&rdquo; from the locality where the best
crystals are obtained.</p>
<p>Sagenitic Quartz.&mdash;This form of
quartz, also known as &ldquo;sagenite,&rdquo; &ldquo;fleche
d&rsquo;amour&rdquo; (love&rsquo;s arrow), &ldquo;Venus&rsquo; hair
stone,&rdquo; and, if the included mineral be
rutile, &ldquo;rutilated quartz,&rdquo; is rock crystal
containing inclusions of other minerals
in hair-like or thread-like forms. Of the
minerals so included, rutile is the most
common, but tourmaline, hornblende, epidote
and others occur. These minerals
are formed in the quartz doubtless by
crystallizing simultaneously with that
mineral, or &ldquo;host,&rdquo; as it is called. The
arrangement often gives a stone of great
beauty, especially when the rutile is more
or less transparent and has a blood red
color. The Japanese frequently polish
the surfaces of such crystals of quartz to
make the interior structure better visible.
Specimens are also obtained from Madagascar,
Brazil, and North Carolina in our
own country. When the fibers of the
included mineral are smaller and more
abundant, the forms of quartz known as
&ldquo;cat&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; and &ldquo;tiger eye&rdquo; are produced.
The reflection of light from the surfaces
of the fibers gives the glittering effect
known as chatoyancy. Nearly all the
&ldquo;tiger eye&rdquo; in use at the present time
comes from South Africa; the cat&rsquo;s eye
from Bohemia and Ceylon.</p>

<h2 id="c15">BERRIES OF THE WOODS.</h2>
<p>There are no flowers to make the earth
gay in winter, but the berries, vivid, scarlet,
like a note of exclamation or emphasis,
light up the somber browns and
grays of the woods and marshes.
Jack-in-the-pulpit now shows a brilliant cluster,
the Uncle Spadix completely hidden
by the flaming berries. It is as if Jack
had forsaken his pulpit altogether and
turned to a rollicking life in the world.
We know quite well without seeing the
birds feed on any special variety of berry
that they like them, for in the economy of
thrifty Dame Nature these vivid colors
of the outer cases are signals&mdash;calls to a
feast, with the prudent condition that
thus the seeds shall be carried abroad.</p>
<p>Holly stands at the head of all the
berry tribe, royal by virtue not only of its
shining clusters of fruit, but its glossy
leaves, deep cut on the edges, that keep
their beauty so long. It is usually a
shrub, but in the mountains where the
conditions are favorable it towers aloft
as a tree. Another less famous, yet admirable
member of the Ilex family with
red berries whirled most gracefully
around its stem, is the winterberry or
black alder. Its foliage is less beautiful
than that of the holly, but its berries
are as brilliant. There are different
splendors for North and South. In the
North, when the white frosts fall the
prickly barberry bushes are already loaded
with their tart scarlet berries, and the
old fences are rich with the fruit of the
choke cherry. In the damp places of
Southern woods the spice berries of the
Laurel family are shining in small clusters.
You are drawn by another sense in
this case, for the berries are not only
pleasing to the eye; they have also a
delightfully pungent fragrance, especially
when the scarlet skin is broken, and
shows the yellow pulp inside.</p>
<p>The staff-tree, shrubby bitter-sweet
or strawberry tree&mdash;for it has many
names&mdash;glows with its odd-looking fruit,
consisting of a scarlet aril and orange-tinted,
or crimson pods or seeds. The
aril plays a different part in various
plants, though it is always a seed-covering;
in the water-lily it is the transparent
seed-bag, in the nutmeg it is the mace, in
the twining strawberry bush it is a pulpy
scarlet case; in the shrub it looks rather
like a red chestnut burr, split wide open
to show its gay seeds. There is a low
shrub whose dark purplish red berries
are arranged gracefully along its slender
stems, called the snow or coral berry.
The latter name suggests a far
brighter color than the berries possess,
for they are rarely noticeable until the
winter snows have turned the earth white
and by contrast made them attractive.
This belongs to the Honeysuckle family
and grows abundantly beside roads and
in fence corners. Most of the honeysuckles
bear berries; the local honeysuckle
is almost as brilliant in the season
of fruit as when it blooms, but the Chinese
and Japanese honeysuckles have
berries of glossy black, easily seen by the
birds. The haw and the tupelo also
bear black berries, and it is a pretty sight
to see the flowers of gay yellow and the
black sapsuckers just arrived from the
North, rejoicing over the feast of the
purple-black clusters of the tupelo. Other
birds also love them and the trees are
crowded till the migration is over.</p>
<p>The pale blue adar berries are as fragrant
as they are pretty, thickly clustered
in the prickly boughs. The mistletoe
(Trees-thief as its Greek name means)
grows upon our great oaks, hanging
sprays of pearly or clouded opaline berries
among its strange, thick, yellowish
leaves. It is not the English mistletoe
of Christmas stories which grows upon
fir-trees in preference to all others, but is
of similar habit.</p>

<h2 id="c16">EARLY RECOLLECTIONS OF NATURAL OBJECTS.</h2>
<p>In the inanimate world the things
which most strongly impressed me were
the many beautiful scenes of the winter
season, such as the graceful drooping of
the evergreens after a heavy snow fall;
the thousands of domed, draped and
capped objects at this time; the many
beautiful designs of ferns, grasses, wheat
sheaves, coral branches, etc., formed by
the frost upon our windows, and the unmatchable
splendor of the trees and other
objects after receiving a coating of ice
during a sleet storm. The lovely display
of blossoms in the spring time, and the
crimson leaves of autumn, also called
forth expressions of joy and pleasure.</p>
<p>Among flowers, the wild blue violet
is the first blossom that I remember having
found and gathered. They were
plentiful in the woods, meadows and
roadsides, and we always kept one or
more bunches of these and other wild
flowers in the house during the spring
season. Next to the blue violet, the dog-tooth
violet, buttercups, spring beauties,
dandelions and daisies follow in memory&rsquo;s
train.</p>
<p>My mother always accompanied me on
my first little rambles, and many are the
pleasant strolls we took, hand in hand,
gathering flowers, listening to the songs
of birds and enjoying the beautiful surroundings;
her training and instruction
in Nature&rsquo;s book doubtless laid the foundation
of my devotion to and study of
these things in later years. Did she not
call my attention to the gorgeous sunsets,
to the bow of promise spanning
the sky, to the squirrels and other little
animals of the woods, to the rippling
brook splashing over its pebbles and
golden sands; did she not teach me to
love God&rsquo;s creatures and not kill or destroy
them? Happy days never to be forgotten;
little friendships never broken.</p>

<h2 id="c17">TWO STRANGE HOMES.</h2>
<p>The little brown wren is a bird with
which most of us are familiar, as it is
one of our most common birds. It builds
its nest in all sorts of odd places, venturing
about barns, outhouses, or even
the homes of men.</p>
<p>One summer a ball of twine left over
from the harvesting was placed upon a
shelf in our tool-house. The next spring
a pair of tiny wrens discovered it and
selected it as a suitable nesting place.
They built the coziest and softest of
homes in the hole in the center of the
big ball and several eggs were laid before
we discovered it. It was then left
to the birds who had taken possession
of it and they were allowed to raise their
family there in peace.</p>
<p>At another time a pair of wrens built
their nest in the sleeve of an old coat
which had been left hanging in a shed
and they made what, at least to them,
was quite a palatial abode in that which
superior man had deemed unfit for use.</p>

<h2 id="c18">THE GREENLAND WHALE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Balaena mysticetus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The whale is by far the largest animal
on earth, some species being many times
the size of an elephant, and is it not
a curious fact that in appearance it so
resembles a fish that many suppose it
to belong to that class, while truly it is
not a fish at all? It is in reality much
more like a cow or a horse, although
externally it seems very unlike these animals;
but appearances are not always to
be relied upon.</p>
<p>When we examine the construction of
the whale we find that it is warm-blooded,
as we are. We find that it has immense
lungs which hold a great quantity of
air and that it must fill them or die. We
find that it has bones similar to those of
land animals. It has the seven neck
bones found in all mammals, but it is
the opposite extreme from the giraffe,
as in proportion to its size it has the
shortest neck of any mammal, while the
giraffe has the longest. It has ribs, also
bones for the forearm, and, nearly obliterated,
there are found bones representing
the hind legs. Instead of being
hatched from an egg, as most fishes are,
a baby whale comes into the world alive
and complete, and for many months it
takes its mother&rsquo;s milk as a calf might do
or a young colt. A baby whale is indeed
a monstrous infant, being sometimes
ten or twelve or even fifteen feet long;
but by its mother&rsquo;s side it does not seem
such a monstrosity, for the whale mother
may be forty-five or fifty feet in length
herself.</p>
<p>These great animals are a most interesting
study, for their ancestors undoubtedly
once lived on land. We can imagine
the land animal, many centuries ago,
dwelling on the banks of some large
stream, fond of spending much time in
the water, until with successive generations
the shape of the animal gradually
changed and adapted itself to its fluid
surroundings. The forearms and hands
gradually became covered with continuous
skin until the arm and hand became
a flipper; the rear limbs grew shorter
and snorter as they were used less and
less, until finally there was nothing left
to indicate their presence except a few
small bones. The tail, used as a propeller,
grew strong, large and flat, and
we can imagine that the animals themselves,
as they put out to sea and in time
avoided even the rivers, became larger
as the centuries passed by.</p>
<p>However this may be, the Greenland
Whale has been found sixty feet in
length, although some other species are
smaller.</p>
<p>I think we can consider the whale an
animal of a roving disposition. In early
times it roved away from land, and now
it belongs to the migratory animals,
changing its locality with the seasons.
The Greenland Whale is happiest with
cold and ice, so when summer comes it
travels north in great numbers. These
great groups are called schools, and being
of a social disposition, it is seldom
found alone when traveling. At first
thought it would seem strange that a
warm-blooded animal with no fur to protect
it could so enjoy the cold, but should
we examine beneath the soft, velvety
skin we would find a great layer of fat,
from ten to eighteen inches thick. This
protects the animal from cold like a great
soft overcoat, and the polar sea has for it
no terrors.</p>
<p>Of the peculiar make-up of the Greenland
Whale the head is certainly the most
peculiar of all the parts.</p>
<p>It is a great, shapeless mass about a
third of the length of the entire animal.
It seems to be out of all proportion until
one realizes that it must provide food for
this great creature, which is no small
task. Like all of the whalebone whales,
the Greenland Whale has no teeth, but
in the mouth is found a great number of
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
flexible, bone-like appendages attached to
the roof of the mouth and palate at one
end and hanging loose at the opposite
end. These are known as the baleen
plates and form the whalebone of commerce.
In the Greenland Whale this
whalebone hanging from the center of
the jaw is sometimes twelve feet in
length, and as there are from two hundred
and fifty to four hundred in number,
the great value of the baleen is readily
seen. When the great animal opens its
mouth, a row boat with its oarsmen could
easily be taken in, yet the animal eats
only small crustaceans, mollusks, worms
and minute forms of life.</p>
<p>When the immense mouth opens, it
takes in a large amount of water containing
its food. The mouth then closes,
but the water is permitted to flow out,
the baleen acting like a sieve, retaining
the food supply within and allowing the
water to ooze away. The food is retained
on the great tongue and swallowed
at leisure.</p>
<p>The eye of the whale is very small; the
ear is barely perceptible, yet when submerged,
the sight is keen and the hearing
well developed. The nostrils are
placed on the top of the head, so that
the whale when rising can readily begin
the operation of breathing. With a
snorting noise the animal first blows up
the water which has entered the imperfectly
closed nostrils when submerged.
This is done with such force that the
water is separated into fine drops and
thrown fifteen or eighteen feet into the
air. The whale then breathes with a
rapid inspiration, making a sort of moaning
sound. When the lungs are filled
with air, it will plunge beneath the surface
of the water and remain for perhaps
twenty minutes before appearing again,
although when wounded it remains under
water a much longer time.</p>
<p>In spite of its great size the whale is so
perfectly adapted to its surroundings that
it is a highly active animal. It swims
without apparent effort and on account
of the great strength of the enormous
horizontal tail fin, it can jerk itself above
the water and take long leaps. The
smoothness of the skin facilitates the
passage of the immense bulk through the
water and the thick layer of fat diminishes
the weight so that a whale can
move with the rapidity of a steamship.</p>
<p>The Greenland Whale is, on the whole,
an amiable animal. It seems to prefer to
live at peace with its kind, and although
it can make great havoc with its immense
tail fin, it seemingly does so by accident
rather than from viciousness.</p>
<p>Like all other animals the whale has
its enemies, especially when young. The
killer-whale and some sharks hunt and
attack the young whales, as indeed they
do the older ones; but the greatest enemy
of all is man. For a thousand years he
has systematically pursued and captured
many species, until some are nearly exterminated.
The Americans became great
whale hunters in the nineteenth century,
and in the thirty-eight years from 1835
to 1872 nearly 20,000 ships engaged in
this industry. These whaling ships were
fitted especially for this work. They
were built to withstand the perils of the
ice-bound northern seas and were arranged
for long voyages. It was a sad
day in the coast villages when the whalers
sailed on these long, perilous and uncertain
cruises, for the ships frequently were
gone three years and some never came
back, though as a whole the actual loss
of human life was comparatively small.
A number of ships would if possible keep
sufficiently near together to render assistance
in case of accident.</p>
<p>After reaching the whaling grounds
usually two men were kept on the mast
as a lookout. When the cry came, &ldquo;There
they spout!&rdquo; all became excitement. As
soon as it was determined that the
whales were the species which they were
seeking, the boats were lowered, the harpoons,
the lances, the gun, the hatchet,
the knife, the blubber-spade, and, most
important of all, the line, were all placed
in the boat together with a keg of fresh
water, some ship&rsquo;s biscuit, the lantern,
candles and matches; and in a very short
time the men were lustily pulling toward
the monster they hoped to capture. They
endeavored to approach the whale from
the rear and often were not discovered
by the animal until the harpoons were
buried in its body. The boat was then
rowed backward with great speed, as
the whale could easily annihilate it with
one blow of its great tail. Frequently
the whale would dive down perpendicularly
to a great depth and if the line was
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
not sufficiently long it would of course
pull the boat after it. In time the whale
was obliged to rise for air and the struggle
was renewed. Other boats approached
and threw their harpoons, and
the whale either turned upon its tormentors
or ran, dragging the boats after
it. In time it became exhausted and
then it was killed either with the gun,
harpoon or a hand lance. It was then
towed to the ship&rsquo;s side, made fast with
chains and placed to float head backwards.
The blubber was then torn off
by means of pulleys and tackle. This
process lasted from four to eight hours.
The upper jaw of the whalebone whale
or the lower jaw of the sperm whale
was then cut off and taken on deck.
After all the valuable parts were taken
the carcass was cast adrift. The blubber
was then cut into pieces and tried out, the
oil being stowed away in barrels. The
value of the whale may be as high as
$10,000.</p>
<p>The trying out of the oil is indeed a
weird sight. At first, wood is used as a
fuel, but afterward the residue of the
blubber, called cracklings, is used, as it
possesses sufficient heating power to finish
the work. &ldquo;Attired in their worst
clothes,&rdquo; writes Pechuel-Loeschke, &ldquo;half-naked,
dancing and singing, running
after one another and brandishing their
tools, dripping with oil and sooty like
devils, the crew disport themselves about
the hearth. An intensely active life prevails
on board. The sight of this activity
is doubly striking by night when a mass
of the cracklings is hoisted up in an iron
basket. This strange torch burns merrily,
casting a weird light on the scene
as the blazing flames throw glaring, fitful
rays on the deck and bring out in bold
relief the black clouds of smoke and the
masts with their sails, the reflection extending
far out over the sea. By day
huge masses of smoke on the horizon
betray the presence of a whaler which
&lsquo;tries out&rsquo; the blubber, long before one
catches sight of the ship itself.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c20">THE THISTLE.</h2>
<p>As plants were among the objects most
familiar to primitive man, they naturally
came to be considered good or evil, according
as their properties were found to
be beneficial or injurious. The imaginative
and pure reverence, however,
which originally linked plant life with
the personifications of natural phenomena,
soon degenerated into a superstitious
worship and became associated with the
mummery of various kinds of impostors.
The plants, through the manipulations of
the quacks and witches, who largely composed
the fraternity of the early herbalists,
became endowed with powers to kill
or heal, to control the weather, to gain or
hold friends, and many other associations
that have clung to them ever since.
The Thistle appears to have been especially
favored in this regard. It appears
that an eagle had stolen the sacred Soma
from the Hindu tree of life. Barely had
he departed with the immortalizing
draught before he was overtaken by a
lightning bolt and stretched lifeless upon
the earth. From the eagle&rsquo;s feathers
sprang up the bramble, while the Thistle
grew from his claws. About this time
Loki, the evil spirit of the Norse Asgard,
passed that way, bent upon mischief. The
unpleasant qualities of the two plants at
once appealed to him. Loki immediately
gathered the seed and proceeded to sow
them in the fields of his enemies, the result
being that all the good seed was
killed. This Aryan myth has given rise
to the expression, &ldquo;Sowing wild oats,&rdquo;
and is believed to be the origin of the
biblical story of the tares and the wheat,
coming into Hebrew literature by means
of the Indo-Iranians at the time of the
Israelitish exile.</p>
<p>Now, Thor observed what Loki had
done; so he hurled his hammer at the
brambles and a bolt of lightning at the
Thistles. For this reason the thistle blossoms
are colored red and the plants became
lightning plants. But the end was
not yet. The beautiful goddess Freya,
seeing the Thistles drooping under the
chastisement of the god, took compassion
and gave them to drink of the mead from
the sacred goat of Valhalla, by virtue of
which the plants became invested with
immortality. Thus it came to pass that
the Thistle has a dual life. It is a lightning
plant, in which, in common with
similar forms, like the vervain, the hazel,
and the ash is never injured by lightning
or approached by serpents. On the
other hand, it being a protege of Freya,
the goddess of Love, it straightway became
a powerful love charm, and doubtless
has done much execution in Cupid&rsquo;s
lists.</p>
<p>The Thistle group is the most primitive
of the Composite family, and it bears evidence
of a vast evolutionary history.
There are one hundred and seventy-five
living species which are distributed over
Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South
America. The plants seem able to adapt
themselves to almost any conditions, and
their unpleasant spines are found bidding
defiance to the reindeer near the
Arctic circle, as well as successfully measuring
strength with the prickly cactus
and acacias of the tropics. On our own
prairies only plants thus armed stand
much show to survive the herds of cattle
that wander over them, and this protection,
together with their great productiveness,
have rendered Thistles such a
nuisance and menace to agricultural interests
as to necessitate legislative action
looking to their extermination. The Russian
and Canada thistles are the worst
offenders, and where they once obtain a
foothold they, as a rule, remain. The
unpleasant qualities of the Thistle, however,
served to bring about its adoption
as the national emblem of Scotland. The
story relates that during the eighth century
the invading Danes, while stealing
up to the Scotch camp under cover
of darkness, passed over a patch of
cotton thistle, and the sudden cries
of the injured men warned the guards,
and thus the army was saved.
Achaius, King of Scotland, adopted the
plant as his emblem in recognition of this
service, but it was not made a part of the
national arms until the middle of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<br /><span class="small">FROM &ldquo;NATURE&rsquo;S GARDEN&rdquo;</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The origin of the Scottish order of the
Thistle, or St. Andrew, is somewhat uncertain.
In 1687 it was restored to favor
by James II of England and was given
much prominence during the reign of
Queen Anne. The membership was limited
to from twelve to sixteen peers of
the realm, the insignia being a golden collar
composed of sixteen thistles, from
which hung a St. Andrew&rsquo;s cross.</p>
<p>What is known as the purple star thistle
was named for Chiron the Centaur.
The great spines on the calyx suggested
the military caltrop, an iron star of four
points, which was used in battle to annoy
horses.</p>
<p>Among other incidents in which Thistles
have been in evidence may be mentioned
the confusion into which the army
of Charles the Bold was thrown, in 1465,
because of the deceptive appearance of
the plants. The Burgundians were beseiging
Paris, and while the army slept
scouts brought word that great numbers
of spears were assembled outside the city
walls. A panic was narrowly averted,
and later it was discovered that the stems
and spines of some very tall Thistles had
produced the deception. The leaves of
the Thistles were commonly employed
by the Roman soldiers to shade their helmets,
and it is stated that when Hugh
Spencer, favorite of Edward II, was
hanged, the mob, in derision, placed a
crown of thistle spines upon his head.</p>
<p>Thistles seem to have figured in peace
as well as war. In England the teasel is
indispensable in the cloth mills, in which
it is employed to dress the nap of the
fabrics, and Virgil tells of the vest of
Helen, which was embroidered to represent
the plants, while the handles of the
Cup of Eurymedon were entwined with
them. Probably the crowning glory of
the Thistle, if the story be true, lies in
its contribution to architecture, in which
capacity it deserves no less consideration
than the Egyptian lotus. It appears from
the narrative that a young girl of Corinth
dying, her nurse placed on her
grave a basket containing her toys, covering
them with a large tile in order to
shield the childish treasures from the
weather. The basket was set by chance
on the root of a Thistle. When the
springtime came the plant grew until,
meeting the tile, it was forced to turn
downwards in graceful folds, which,
catching the eye of Callimachus, he conceived
the capital of the Corinthian columns.</p>

<h2 id="c23">THE BIRDS IN THEIR WINTER HOME.
<br /><span class="small">(In the Woods.)</span></h2>
<p>From the region of the Great Lakes
to the Gulf there is no section that contains
more to interest the naturalist than
the hills and forests of central Mississippi.
Here no winter&rsquo;s rigors chill the
blood and drive the forest folk to remote
or inaccessible retreats. Into this land
of warmth and sunshine, this land of the
&rsquo;possum, persimmon and the pickaninny,
Jack Frost does not come till November
is well advanced. Even then he comes
only to clear the air, bring down the
leaves, and announce the coming of the
short, make-believe winter.</p>
<p>Go out doors in December after the
leaves have fallen and take note of the
varied life in wood, field and brake; think
that now in the far away North the wind
howls through the leafless trees, finding
few creatures hardy enough to resist his
blasts save the snowbird and the hare.
The blasts of chill November and chillier
December have sent myriads of birds
down here where food is plenty in savannah,
forest and thicket. On the wooded
knolls under the beeches and hollies congregate
the hungry hordes, feasting on
seeds and berries of the rattan, holly and
smilax. Flying in and out of the briar-thickets
are innumerable white-throated
sparrows fleeing from frozen Canada and
the lake country. A clear long-drawn
whistle strikes the ear. We seek the
source. A little brown bird much the size
and shape of an English sparrow seated
on a shrub projecting from the briars
raises his head and whistles a sound as
pure and free from flaw as the little spot
of white upon his throat. Cheewinks as
fussy as old hens toss the dead leaves
about; grackles in shining black stalk
dignifiedly about; while cardinals in low
boughs and underbrush give a touch of
vivid color to the scene just as the pink
and white dresses of the girls form a
pleasing contrast to the somber blacks
and grays of the gentlemen&rsquo;s attire at a
Fourth of July celebration.</p>
<p>Second to none in delicate beauty of
coloring, king of his tribe, is the fox-sparrow.
Russet and rufous on the back,
beneath the white marked with brilliant
stripings of the same color as the back,
on the feathers of his head and upper
neck a clear pearly luster which is iridescent
in the sunshine but invisible in the
shadow, he is a marked bird, the peer of
any in the woods. Happy the bird-lover
who has the opportunity to study this
magnificent bird in his winter home; one
so favored can well afford a feeling of
pity for the less fortunate dwellers in the
central states who seldom make his acquaintance
except through the medium
of the museum or the manual.</p>
<p>Florida blue jays in black, white and
blue hop about among the rustling leaves
or seated on a limb, hammer away at an
acorn. Possessing a more extensive vocabulary
than our familiar Northern jays,
more loquacious, more sociable, they are
certainly the artists of the tribe. No one
who has ever heard their clear musical
notes as they play in the tree-tops or hop
about on the lawns as friendly and cheerful
as robins, can ever entertain quite
such a low opinion of their musical ability
as he did before. Resonant, ringing tinkling,
this call is the forest chime that
summons the little children of the wood
to vespers, heard at evening with white
throats calling to one another from brush-heaps
and briar thicket, it is the expression
of this strong pure life away from
the haunts of men. Under such surroundings
it is easy to forget the cruelty
practiced by our gifted blue-coat when
spring has filled these woods and fields
with nests and nestlings.</p>
<p>But here comes one for whom no cloak
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
of charity is needed, the musician pre-eminent
among all this gifted throng, the
Carolina wren. A slender curved beak,
a trim bunch of cinnamon-brown feathers
barred with darker brown on wings and
tail, a buff breast, a little throat pulsating
with vigorous buoyant life are the most
conspicuous characteristics of this chorister
of winter woods. He has been called
the mocking wren. Let no one be deluded
by such a term into the belief that
he has no individuality, for, although his
song has in it the whistle of the cardinal,
the dignified song of the brown thrasher
and the effervescence of the mockingbird,
through it all there runs a peculiar
quality all his own. Swinging on a rattan
vine, singing with all the abandon of
a bright May morning he seems the most
vigorous exponent of &ldquo;the strenuous life&rdquo;
in this land where languorous breezes blow
soft and warm, bringing with them a suggestion
of the sun-kissed waters of the
Gulf and odors of resin and turpentine
from the interminable forests that intervene
between us and the coast.</p>
<p>Down by the branches on cold frosty
mornings you will find a little brown ball
of a bird, that with tail tilted up over his
back dives under every bridge, slides into
every brush-heap, or hides tantalizingly
behind every log that comes in his path.
Not shy, yet not bold, he disappears from
view at the most exasperating moments.
Coming with the frosts, going away when
they cease, he certainly deserves the name
of winter wren. Shorter than the Carolina,
darker on the back and tail, his nervous,
fidgety manner makes it an easy
matter to distinguish him from his more
talented cousin. In these winter woods
he never sings. Beyond an occasional
metallic &ldquo;chip&rdquo; now and then I have
never heard him give utterance to the
emotions that fill his plump little breast.
He is the silent observer of the busy life
about him, a sitter in his own chimney
corner, where he smokes his pipe and
studies life subjectively, a modest little
philosopher in cinnamon brown and
black.</p>
<p>Darting in and out among the lower
branches of a giant beech, now flitting to
a new position with movements as sudden
and unexpected as those of a hummingbird,
now running along a limb like the
brown creeper, comes another tiny friend
the ruby crowned kinglet. A plain little
Quaker he seems in his suit of olive
green without a patch of yellow or black
to relieve the severe simplicity of his
garb. Even the tufts of brilliant red feathers
on his head is concealed from vulgar
gaze. If you have sharp eyes and a
moderate degree of patience your efforts
to get a glimpse of the red tuft will by
and by be crowned with success, but don&rsquo;t
be disappointed if you don&rsquo;t see the ruby
the first time you see the bird. I had observed
the cheerful little chap time after
time in my morning rambles in the
woods, and had come to know every
twist and motion of the tiny body before
I caught a glimpse of the longed-for tuft.
Finally one morning as he bent his head
to pick up some sweet tid-bit the olive-green
feathers parted and I saw his tiny
crown. A modest genial little anarchist
he is, never parading his opinions before
an admiring public, but suddenly springing
down in front of us on some low bush
he flaunts his red flag and is gone before
we realize it. Having once learned how
and when to look for his crown it is an
easy matter to find it again whenever his
little majesty feels inclined to give you
the opportunity.</p>

<p class="t4">A weary weed toss&rsquo;d to and fro,</p>
<p class="t0">Drearily drench&rsquo;t in the ocean brine.</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;Cornelius G. Fenner, &ldquo;Gulf-Weed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Those who have spent any time along
the sea shore will recall the familiar seaweeds
washed upon the bank by the tide
and have watched them idly waving to
and fro in the water near the shore
where the depth does not exceed several
meters. There are perhaps no plants more
beautiful from the purely artistic point of
view. Many a visitor to a distant sea
coast has collected and mounted the more
beautiful and delicate ones as souvenirs
to delight the eye of friends. The delicate
coloring and manifold branchings are
the characteristic of the more attractive
species. Some are quite small, while others
grow to enormous size. The so-called
&ldquo;sea lettuce&rdquo; is of a bright grass green
color, forming a large leaf like expansion.
The Gulf weed, a species of Sargassum,
is very plentiful in the gulf regions
of the southern United States,
Mexico and Central America. During
heavy storms great quantities of this are
torn loose from their fastenings and carried
far out into the Atlantic where they
form the Sargassa sea and impede ocean
traffic. The sailors on the ships of Columbus
encountered such a sea and revived
their hopes of soon seeing land, as
they rightfully conjectured that the sea
weeds were washed from the shore.</p>
<p>Sea weeds in general are variously employed.
They are the sources of iodine
and bromine. They are collected in large
quantities and used as fertilizers. The
Chinese and Japanese use some species
very extensively as food. The stipes or
stalks of Laminaria cloustoni are used in
surgery.</p>
<p>Sea weeds and other aquatic plants
serve as a protection and food for a host
of animals of the seas; especially fish,
cray-fish, lobsters, etc. The smaller fish
in trying to escape from his larger, ravenous
enemy hides among these plants.
Bryant, in Sella says:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here were mighty groves</p>
<p class="t0">Far down the ocean-valleys, and between</p>
<p class="t0">Lay what might seem fair meadows, softly tinged</p>
<p class="t0">With orange and with crimson. Here arose</p>
<p class="t0">Tall stems, that, rooted in the depths below,</p>
<p class="t0">Swing idly with the motion of the sea;</p>
<p class="t0">And here were shrubberies in whose mazy screen,</p>
<p class="t0">The creatures of the deep made haunt.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Chondrus crispus, the plant of our
sketch, is a sea weed of the Atlantic. It
is quite plentiful along the shore lines of
the Atlantic states, Ireland and England.
It is commonly known as Irish moss,
though it is not a moss at all. It is also
known as Carrageen moss or Carrageen.
It is a perennial plant, 3 to 10 inches
high, consisting of a flat, much branched
thallus, as shown in the illustration. It is
variable in its coloring, greenish purple,
purplish brown, grayish purplish brown,
etc., somewhat waxy or translucent in appearance.
It is also very variable in
form; no two specimens being exactly
alike. It attaches itself to rocks, pebbles
and boulders by means of a basal disk
which serves merely as a mechanical support,
the frond or thallus absorbing its
nourishment from the sea water. In consistency
the plant is cartilaginous, mucilaginous,
and is entirely dissolved on boiling.
When dry it becomes very hard,
brittle and elastic and assumes a light-yellowish,
translucent appearance. Chondrus
crispus is closely similar to Gigartina
mamillosa, another sea weed, with
which it is usually associated.</p>
<p>Irish moss is extensively collected
along the coast of Massachusetts. The
plants being spread high up on the beach
to dry and bleach in the sun. Its principal
use is in medicine, although it has perhaps
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
no curative properties in itself. It
is a demulcent and emollient, that is the
mucilage present tends to allay irritation
of inflamed mucous membranes as in
sore throat, pulmonary complaints, etc.
It has been extensively employed as a
popular remedy in dysentery, kidney
troubles and pneumonia. Its principal
use at the present time is as an article of
diet, in the preparation of soup, blanc
mange and jellies. Sometimes it is combined
with chocolate or cocoa, sugar,
lemon juice, etc., to improve the flavor.</p>
<p>Bandoline, a fixative for keeping hair
in curl is commonly prepared from carrageen.
It is also used as sizing for paper,
straw hats, felt hats, cotton goods and for
thickening the colors used in calico printing.
It is also used for clarifying coffee,
beer and other drinks.</p>
<p>Carrageen is a word of Irish origin and
was apparently originally applied to sea
weeds in general. The Irish were the
first to use this plant medicinally and as a
food.</p>
